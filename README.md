# Awesome 3D Scene Understanding
This repo collects papers, docs, codes about 3D Scene Understanding for anyone who wants to do research on it. We are continuously improving the project. Welcome to PR the works (papers, repositories) that are missed by the repo. Special thanks to [Fucheng Cai](https://github.com/HITCai), [Zhe yang](https://github.com/xia-zhe), and all researchers who have contributed to this project!
